# High Performance Programming and Systems (HPPS)

## Overall structure

HPPS takes place in block 2.  The teaching activities are based on the
idea of [flipped
classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), where
the lectures are shorter and available as self-study videos, and 
the lecture time is instead used to solve and discuss problems.

Since we are teaching remotely this year, we have two kinds of
teaching sessions: **labs** and **exercise classes**.  You will be
assigned **videos** and **reading**.

The videos are available in advance, and must be viewed before
attending the lectures. The videos stay available throughout the course
so you are free to (re-)view them whenever it suits you.

In the **labs** we will focus on solving concrete problems in small
virtual groups (or physically, as the pandemic and KU permits). The
problems are usually related to the mandatory assignments. After each
sub-problem we will gather and discuss the challenges, pitfalls and
strategies for the problem.

As the exam will be a written exam, the **exercise sessions** will be
focused on solving problems similar to those that will be used in the
exam.

## Textbook

The textbooks are as follows:

* [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3rd edition](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/)

* [Modern C](https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/) ([CC-licensed PDF](https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/latestfile/5298/ModernC.pdf))

* [HPPS course notes](notes.pdf) - **these will be updated as the
  course progresses, so make sure to regularlyl check that you have
  the newest version**

### Videos

The authors of the CS:APP textbook [have made videos available of ther
lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmBgoRqEQCWy58EIwLSWwMPfkwLOLRM5R).
Note that these lectures are from a classic systems programming
course, with a different focus (and much longer length) than HPPS.
However, they may still be worth watching.

## Schedule

The **labs** take place on

* Tuesday 10:15-12:00

* Thursday 13:15-15:00

The **exercise classes** take place on

* Thursday 15:15-17:00

Once we know whether we will be allowed to meet physically, we will
add this information.

## Discord

Virtual labs and exercise classes take place on [this Discord
server](https://discord.com/channels/768764206383366185/) ([invite
link](https://discord.gg/KdXMA3v)).  Note that teachers and TAs are
only expected to respond during normal class hours.

## Assignments

There are 4 assignment in total during the course with deadline
roughly every week and a half.

The assignments will be graded with points from 0 to 4 and it is not
possible to re-hand-in any of the assignments.

Assignments are made to be solved in groups of preferably three
students, but groups of two active students will also do. We strongly
encourage you not to work alone. Groups cannot be larger than three
students. Each group must make their own solutions and cannot share
implementations and report with other. You may however discuss
material and ideas.

## Exam qualification

To qualify for the exam you are required to achieve at least 50% of
the total number of points in the four assignments (that is, 8 points
at minimum).

It is also important to note, that the main purpose of the assignments
are not to prepare you for the exam; that is what the exercise classes
are for. The assignments will focus on larger implementations and the
practical learning goals of the course. Some questions in the exam
will relate to the assignments, but qualifying of the exam (and even
fully solving the assignments) will not be enough preparation to pass
the exam. You need to make the exercises and the best way is to be
active in the exercise classes.

## Languages

All written material will be in **English**.

Most oral teaching will be in **Danish** or **English**, depending on
the specific teacher or TA.

You will be mainly be programming in **C** and **Python**.

## Software

You will be using a Unix command line and Unix tools for much of the
course.  [See the Unix software guide.](unix.md)

See also [this guide on the GDB
debugger](http://beej.us/guide/bggdb/), which is a very useful tool
for debugging C programs.

If you prefer an IDE see the [VS Code installation and setup guide](VSCode.md).
